# QuadCropper


## Installation

This app requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to be installed on your machine.

We recommend installing QuadCropper in a Python virtual environment, which you can create with the following command in a new terminal
```
python3 -m venv env
```
On Linux and macOS, you can activate the enviroment with
```
source env/bin/activate
```
on Windows type
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Inside the activated environment upgrade pip
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
and then install QuadCropper via pip
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade QuadCropper
```
Note, that depending on your platform you will have to replace `python3` with `python` or `py` in the commands above.

After successful installation you can start QuadCropper simply by typing in the terminal
```
quadcropper
```
Note, that to start QuadCropper, you will always have to activate the Python virtual environment first.
